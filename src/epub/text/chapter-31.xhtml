			<p>“Doctor,” said Iola, as they walked home from the conversazione, “I wish I could do something more for our people than I am doing. I taught in the South till failing health compelled me to change my employment. But, now that I am well and strong, I would like to do something of lasting service for the race.”</p>
			<p>“Why not,” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer, “write a good, strong book which would be helpful to them? I think there is an amount of dormant talent among us, and a large field from which to gather materials for such a book.”</p>
			<p>“I would do it, willingly, if I could; but one needs both leisure and money to make a successful book. There is material among us for the broadest comedies and the deepest tragedies, but, besides money and leisure, it needs patience, perseverance, courage, and the hand of an artist to weave it into the literature of the country.”</p>
			<p>“Miss Leroy, you have a large and rich experience; you possess a vivid imagination and glowing fancy. Write, out of the fullness of your heart, a book to inspire men and women with a deeper sense of justice and humanity.”</p>
			<p>“Doctor,” replied Iola, “I would do it if I could, not for the money it might bring, but for the good it might do. But who believes any good can come out of the black Nazareth?”</p>
			<p>“Miss Leroy, out of the race must come its own thinkers and writers. Authors belonging to the white race have written good racial books, for which I am deeply grateful, but it seems to be almost impossible for a white man to put himself completely in our place. No man can feel the iron which enters another man’s soul.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Doctor, when I write a book I shall take you for the hero of my story.”</p>
			<p>“Why, what have I done,” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer, in a surprised tone, “that you should impale me on your pen?”</p>
			<p>“You have done nobly,” answered Iola, “in refusing your grandmother’s offer.”</p>
			<p>“I only did my duty,” he modestly replied.</p>
			<p>“But,” said Iola, “when others are trying to slip out from the race and pass into the white basis, I cannot help admiring one who acts as if he felt that the weaker the race is the closer he would cling to it.”</p>
			<p>“My mother,” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer, “faithful and true, belongs to that race. Where else should I be? But I know a young lady who could have cast her lot with the favored race, yet chose to take her place with the freed people, as their teacher, friend, and adviser. This young lady was alone in the world. She had been fearfully wronged, and to her stricken heart came a brilliant offer of love, home, and social position. But she bound her heart to the mast of duty, closed her ears to the syren song, and could not be lured from her purpose.”</p>
			<p>A startled look stole over Iola’s face, and, lifting her eyes to his, she faltered:⁠—</p>
			<p>“Do you know her?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I know her and admire her; and she ought to be made the subject of a soul-inspiring story. Do you know of whom I speak?”</p>
			<p>“How should I, Doctor? I am sure you have not made me your confidante,” she responded, demurely; then she quickly turned and tripped up the steps of her home, which she had just reached.</p>
			<p>After this conversation <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer became a frequent visitor at Iola’s home, and a firm friend of her brother. Harry was at that age when, for the young and inexperienced, vice puts on her fairest guise and most seductive smiles. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer’s wider knowledge and larger experience made his friendship for Harry very valuable, and the service he rendered him made him a favorite and ever-welcome guest in the family.</p>
			<p>“Are you all alone,” asked Robert, one night, as he entered the cosy little parlor where Iola sat reading. “Where are the rest of the folks?”</p>
			<p>“Mamma and grandma have gone to bed,” answered Iola. “Harry and Lucille are at the concert. They are passionately fond of music, and find facilities here that they do not have in the South. They wouldn’t go to hear a seraph where they must take a negro seat. I was too tired to go. Besides, ‘two’s company and three’s a crowd,’ ” she added, significantly.</p>
			<p>“I reckon you struck the nail on the head that time,” said Robert, laughing. “But you have not been alone all the time. Just as I reached the corner I saw <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer leaving the door. I see he still continues his visits. Who is his patient now?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Uncle Robert,” said Iola, smiling and flushing, “he is out with Harry and Lucille part of the time, and drops in now and then to see us all.”</p>
			<p>“Well,” said Robert, “I suppose the case is now an affair of the heart. But I cannot blame him for it,” he added, looking fondly on the beautiful face of his niece, which sorrow had touched only to chisel into more loveliness. “How do you like him?”</p>
			<p>“I must have within me,” answered Iola, with unaffected truthfulness, “a large amount of hero worship. The characters of the Old Testament I most admire are Moses and Nehemiah. They were willing to put aside their own advantages for their race and country. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer comes up to my ideal of a high, heroic manhood.”</p>
			<p>“I think,” answered Robert, smiling archly, “he would be delighted to hear your opinion of him.”</p>
			<p>“I tell him,” continued Iola, “that he belongs to the days of chivalry. But he smiles and says, ‘he only belongs to the days of hardpan service.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Someone,” said Robert, “was saying today that he stood in his own light when he refused his grandmother’s offer to receive him as her son.”</p>
			<p>“I think,” said Iola, “it was the grandest hour of his life when he made that decision. I have admired him ever since I heard his story.”</p>
			<p>“But, Iola, think of the advantages he set aside. It was no sacrifice for me to remain colored, with my lack of education and race sympathies, but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer had doors open to him as a white man which are forever closed to a colored man. To be born white in this country is to be born to an inheritance of privileges, to hold in your hands the keys that open before you the doors of every occupation, advantage, opportunity, and achievement.”</p>
			<p>“I know that, uncle,” answered Iola; “but even these advantages are too dearly bought if they mean loss of honor, true manliness, and self respect. He could not have retained these had he ignored his mother and lived under a veil of concealment, constantly haunted by a dread of detection. The gain would not have been worth the cost. It were better that he should walk the ruggedest paths of life a true man than tread the softest carpets a moral cripple.”</p>
			<p>“I am afraid,” said Robert, laying his hand caressingly upon her head, “that we are destined to lose the light of our home.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, uncle, how you talk! I never dreamed of what you are thinking,” answered Iola, half reproachfully.</p>
			<p>“And how,” asked Robert, “do you know what I am thinking about?”</p>
			<p>“My dear uncle, I’m not blind.”</p>
			<p>“Neither am I,” replied Robert, significantly, as he left the room.</p>
			<p>Iola’s admiration for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Latimer was not a one-sided affair. Day after day she was filling a larger place in his heart. The touch of her hand thrilled him with emotion. Her lightest words were an entrancing melody to his ear. Her noblest sentiments found a response in his heart. In their desire to help the race their hearts beat in loving unison. One grand and noble purpose was giving tone and color to their lives and strengthening the bonds of affection between them.</p>
